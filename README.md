                                                    VIRTUAL LIBRARY (NAME PENDING)
	The official live link of the site can be found at virtuallibraryy.netlify.app

This is the official code repository of the frontend of my online library, at the moment, it goes by a placeholder name called virtual library.
I made this site to showcase my MERN stack skills and so far, I can say that I succeeded as this site incorporates all the features of a physical library. People can borrow books, read them online, and also return them if they do not like them. After 30 days from the time of returning, the books get automatically returned.
The site also includes top authentication functionalities, users can reset their passwords without contacting the administrator. 
	The Node.js-Express.js written API of the site can be found at this github repository of mine github.com
	A major note to be taken into consideration of this whole project is that, this is a third part of my book trilogy website. The book trilogy website comprises of these projects, “an ecommerce site for books, a book advertisement site which uses audio excerpts of the books, and finally the online library.” At the moment, I am working on the portfolio website to showcase the three projects.
